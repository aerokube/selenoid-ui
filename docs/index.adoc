== Quick Start Guide

=== When you have Docker, there are 3 ways

. If you know exact uri of selenoid - just specify it with `--selenoid-uri`.
No matter this is the same host or not.
+
----
$ docker run -d --name selenoid-ui -p 8080:8080 aerokube/selenoid-ui --selenoid-uri http://${SELENOID_HOST}:4444
----
+
TIP: It can't be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` until the UI is started in the same container as selenoid.

. When the UI and *Selenoid* on the same host you need to determine selenoid uri accessible from UI container.
Usually it can be the docker gateway address.
+
- If you use default network mode, firstly
+
----
$ DOCKER_GATEWAY_ADDR=`docker inspect selenoid -f {{.NetworkSettings.Gateway}}`
$ echo $DOCKER_GATEWAY_ADDR
172.17.0.1 <1>
----
<1> May be different
+
WARNING: For MacOS you should http://blog.michaelhamrah.com/2014/06/accessing-the-docker-host-server-within-a-container/[determine] interface with help of netstat.
Remember that gateway address and host address is not the same in this case.
+
- Then run Selenoid UI
+
----
$ docker run -d --name selenoid-ui -p 8080:8080 aerokube/selenoid-ui --selenoid-uri http://${DOCKER_GATEWAY_ADDR}:4444
----


. On the same host you can just _link_ with *selenoid* container:
- Assumed you have `selenoid` container already up and running
+
----
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                   NAMES
fc479233071d        aerokube/selenoid      "/usr/bin/selenoid..."   10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes       0.0.0.0:4444->4444/tcp                                  selenoid
----
+
- Just run linked UI:
+
----
$ docker run -d         \
    --name selenoid-ui  \
    --link selenoid     \ <1>
    -p 8080:8080        \
    aerokube/selenoid-ui --selenoid-uri=http://selenoid:4444 <2>
----
<1> `selenoid` is name of *Selenoid* container
<2> should be the same as link name
+
NOTE: UI will think that `http://selenoid:4444` is real address of selenoid.
But it's true only inside of UI container.

=== When you don't have Docker
.Or just want to dramatically simplify all the things :)

. Download Selenoid UI binary from https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui/releases[releases] page.

. Start it:
 
    $ ./selenoid-ui --selenoid-uri http://<selenoid-host-or-ip>:4444
    

== Features list:

=== Stats

Shows current quota usage, pending browsers and queue.
Gets updates via SSE, so no need to refresh browser to see what happens.

=== Capabilities

You can choose browser from the available browser list and UI will provide
an example of setup with right capabilities. Examples available for several languages.

=== VNC

If you get browser from selenoid with `enableVNC=true` capability, you can see list of available screens:

.VNC list

VNC allows to see and interact with browser:

.Exact VNC session

Please refer to http://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_live_browser_screen[selenoid documentation] about VNC usage.

=== LOGS

With same as VNC list you can see logs of docker container (no any additional action required)
